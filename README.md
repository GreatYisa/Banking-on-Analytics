# Banking on Analytics: Tailoring Services for Former Student Customers at NovaTrust for Enhanced Loyalty
# Business Overview/Problem
NovaTrust Bank has a large student customer base. Many of these students open their bank accounts while in college. NovaTrust offers specialized student bank services that are tailored to the financial needs and lifestyles of students.

 

Over time, as these students graduate and join the workforce, their financial needs change. Many of them continue to use their student accounts for salary deposits and other financial transactions, perhaps unaware of NovaTrust range of products tailored for working professionals

 

NovaTrust Bank sees an opportunity to provide curated service offerings to these former student customers. The bank wants to identify former student account holders who are now in the workforce and receiving regular salary payments into their accounts. The marketing team is especially interested in customers who've seen at least 10 salary deposits with average salaries exceeding 200,000 naira in the past year. By doing so, NovaTrust hopes to provide these individuals with customized offerings, including tailored loan opportunities and account upgrades.

# Rationale for the Project
Recognizing the lifetime value of customers, it's more cost-effective for NovaTrust Bank to upsell and cross-sell to existing customers than to acquire new ones. Given the established trust and banking history with these customers, NovaTrust has a golden opportunity to enhance their financial experience, presenting them with services tailored to their current life stage and financial power.

 

By identifying former student account holders who've transitioned into the workforce, the bank can craft targeted campaigns to introduce them to services that align with their current financial needs, from home loans to investment advisories.

Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to identify and segment NovaTrust Bank's student customers transitioning into the workforce who are most likely to be interested in the bank’s products & services for working professionals, in order to tailor marketing campaigns introducing them to these products & services, such as credit cards, personal loans, and investment accounts.
